Play with your friends from Facebook or with random rivals in the network!\r\n\r\nAre you a curling fan? Then try this Ultra-Realistic, 3D, Curling Simulation Game.\r\nYou’re not a curling fan? Try Curling3D anyway and you’ll fall in love with curling and our game.\r\n\r\nCurling3D is one of the best curling simulation games for one or two players. Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.\r\n\r\nCurling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.\r\n\r\nTry it… you won’t be disappointed.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZXTQ7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Open House - Hidden Object Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52467.13510798883638088.b3abd538-17b1-4aa8-82a2-1c114839f527.9750632d-14a2-4ebf-8195-e32c56e65e7d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23496.13510798883638088.031e0254-e232-4e3e-a1d7-c87b8f779307.e4d25e2a-9c4e-4da9-8815-e8f9b86e7aaf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BlueArtStudios.OpenHouse-HiddenObjectGame_7w153hasn3z84"],"ContentIds":["bcfbbb3e-6c6d-5a06-dea4-d0f1440643e7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"People in search of a challenging hidden object game that features spectacular graphics and delivers hour after hour of fun, no longer have to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayHOG presents Open House, a Hidden Object Game where we have carefully hidden 40 objects per level in a total of 10 levels to give you 400 objects to find. \r\n\r\n\r\nEach level features 10 distinct achievements to unlock (100 in total for the app), and 40 meticulously well-hidden objects to find (400 in total for the app).  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the aforementioned spectacular graphics – which are richly detailed, stunningly realistic and crafted in vibrant colors – our games have been designed with a number of special features that hidden object game addicts will truly appreciate, including:  \r\n\r\n\r\n•   10 Fun Levels\r\n•   40 Objects Per Level\r\n•   400 Hidden Objects to Find\r\n•   100 Achievements to Unlock and Stars to Earn\r\n•   A handy hint feature that even the most experienced gamer will find invaluable from time to time\r\n•   An excellent help screen that lays out the achievements and other level details\r\n•   A level map that remembers progress and high scores\r\n•   The ability to earn stars by completing achievements\r\n•   Great sound effects that can be toggled on/off (perfect for late-night sessions, on a flight, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not bore users with pointless stories that distract them from the goal of unlocking achievements and finding hidden objects and of course, we don’t force users to make in-app purchases in order to keep playing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Hidden Object Games are difficult, challenging and therefore more suitable for adults, however we are extremely careful about the type of objects and props that we use.

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter.

LAST BLADE” is a fighting game released by SNK in 1997, set in Japan’s Edo period with a roster of unique swordsmen to choose from.\r\nThematically the game is similar to the “SAMURAI SHODOWN\" series, but also features a wealth of innovative systems to set it apart. One such system is the ability to choose between “Power” and “Speed” styles when selecting a character. The “Power” system focuses on high damage while the “Speed” system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique “Hajiki” ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\r\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

This means you can end the game when you have formed enough runs or sets so that the unmatched cards in your deck have a lower overall value than 10. \r\n\r\nYou can choose multiplayer modes like Classic, Quick and Oklahoma Gin and test your card games skills against five different computer opponents.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Multi game mode\r\n- Different difficulty level\r\n- Play with friends\r\n- User stats\r\n- Undo\r\n- Beginner to expert\r\n- Gin Rummy Rules\r\n- Jackpot bonus\r\n\r\nEnjoy it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NXX7DQFDWZJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dead Reckoning: Brassfield Manor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1663.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.c85074fd-39c8-469a-85dc-d6e6444e7660","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23826.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.8439182b-214f-445f-9b17-d7edadda0d8d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18079.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.d0996b11-b4f3-4045-8297-12821d9dd38b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34444.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.a4315c71-1e16-4fa1-a8f8-c5b91f80e581","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£8.39","Price":8.39,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.DeadReckoningBrassfieldManor_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["651e8ef6-fbb6-d17d-161f-f1db261e04f8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"From Eipix Entertainment, makers of Dead Reckoning: Silvermoon Isle and the Final Cut series!\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his annual murder mystery party, wealthy businessman Reginald Greer is found dead at his home.

Tycoon is an indie business strategy game about Computer Evolution and starting your own company in the 70s. Lead the research race until 2034, create the best hardware and operating system, take care of your infrastructure and even handle your marketing. Find video game gems to promote them on your platforms, conquer the global market and became literally immortal!\r\n\r\nComputer Tycoon is different from other building/tycoon games because it has a \"grand strategy game\" aspect. You will control your \"computer empire\" viewing a world map and managing resources.\r\n\r\nStart your adventure in the 70s as a small business somewhere in the world. Learn more about hardware and software inventions that were the first steps to our current modern world, and get a taste of what is waiting for us in the future. Find the classic video games and help a new culture to be born.\r\n\r\nIn Computer Tycoon the decisions you make during development really matter. Take advantage of the technology, upgrade and design combinations! Does your product need more computing capacity or should you focus more on features, low price or prestige? Maybe change to portable computers or develop more easy-to-use Operating Systems? These decisions will have a major impact on the success of your company.\r\n\r\nExpand your corporation in a smart way into multiple countries, build more offices, factories, laboratories and other required facilities. Poor countries have cheaper labor, but richer countries will give you more educated engineers.\r\n\r\nHaving the best product isn't enough. You must take care of people's needs or even \"change their needs\" using different marketing tools. Balance your budget well between development, production, marketing, and expansion.\r\n\r\nWe'll all die one day... but not in Computer Tycoon! You can win the game by becoming a monopoly or reaching the technological singularity if you are fast and healthy enough. Healthy? Yes, you have a small chance to die in the game, so you should regularly check your health.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PD80BRQ6NKF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO SUPER SIDEKICKS","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64311.14154828257216844.30a76c06-872c-4f52-9dfd-da01b3733d9f.2d8cd88f-13c5-45b3-b663-6a294e519082","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12618.14154828257216844.30a76c06-872c-4f52-9dfd-da01b3733d9f.d9b0d6b4-136c-41cf-a389-d884791a2a0e","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41728.14154828257216844.30a76c06-872c-4f52-9dfd-da01b3733d9f.818797fe-2f7f-4dda-9567-8aecd5b9475d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11009.14154828257216844.30a76c06-872c-4f52-9dfd-da01b3733d9f.06d50398-bd6d-498e-b288-631171264f58","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29399.14154828257216844.30a76c06-872c-4f52-9dfd-da01b3733d9f.2226efd1-f888-4ac1-8982-9a951c074226","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£6.09","Price":6.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOSUPERSIDEKICKS_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["05b93943-e8e2-9b43-3afb-3ca2e0bb08ed"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SUPER SIDEKICKS is a soccer game released by SNK in 1992. \r\nThis is the very first realistic-looking soccer game released for the NEOGEO system. \r\nUse a variety of techniques such as dribbling and passing to compete against the best teams from around the world!

has started at the end of 1998 with the simple goal to create a Lemmings clone. \r\n\r\nIf you don't know Lemmings, here comes a short introduction. It is a puzzle game developed in 1991 by DMA Design. The player takes command in the game of a bunch of small animals and has to guide them through levels. Since the animals walk on their own, the player can only influence them by giving them commands, like build a bridge, dig a hole or redirect all animals in the other direction. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for this multiple combination of commands are necessary. The game is presented in a 2D site view. \r\n\r\nWhile Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings, it however doesn't try to be an exact clone, it has included a few ideas of its own, like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. It has also a few new actions, like the jumper which weren't presented in the original game. To get an impression of the look of the Pingus game you might want to have a look at some screenshots. \r\n\r\nSource code is available under the GNU GPL V3 License at: https://github.com/Greentwip/Pingus","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PGCV1MFXM7V","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Clash of Camelot","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60286.14187389605506799.c35b9d5b-dfe5-4a08-bf71-7ec799672dc0.b75cf290-b3db-4eab-a542-d3095bce0460","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28555.14187389605506799.baa285cb-cc3e-4ba4-88d2-ba2aa0547d32.5702ed64-c07a-4018-aad6-ddcc0a5fc364","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35516.14187389605506799.c0d3e813-cd14-4161-8cac-7d599be20f31.7ef7cd45-ffd9-4bf9-baf3-e58a73468ceb","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39726.14187389605506799.2b575fe3-3907-401e-a0a1-9cd0bfe09824.0af2a2f3-95b8-4714-ad8b-0f1a27f165e4","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"£24.99","DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":2.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["44617MaxOn.ClashofCamelot_kc6rb8r68g988"],"ContentIds":["e55a2395-54a0-c96f-7cdc-eb459bea3c31","1e97caf6-40af-3596-ad06-50a5d9b202a7"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"Caomhain £23.30","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to clash of Camelot.

To reach an enemy’s keep, players must launch what is essentially the seed of a new structure, which will sprout into a new building upon landing and erect a wall connecting the new tower to the building that launched it. Each structure boasts its own capabilities, such as constructing other specific buildings, or spawning particular units.  \r\n\r\nPlayers can decide to either quickly attack an opponent’s base, adopt a more defensive strategy by fortifying their own headquarters or maintain a balance of offense and defence. Strategies are influenced by which of the two sides in the conflict players select.

New graphics! We will continue updating the game. Thank you for your support of independent game developers! \r\n\r\nUse your periscope to target and destroy enemy ships. Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here:

To solve the puzzle, the child must slide and snap the colorful puzzle pieces into place to reveal a delightful image.\r\n\r\nWhile your tot or preschooler is being entertained and practicing her basic reading skills, she is building and improving her cognitive, visual/spatial, tactile, and fine motor skills, as well as shape recognition.\r\n\r\nChoosing the preferences option allows you to control the app's level of challenge and interactivity. For instance, you may choose to turn off the puzzle-piece borders displayed in the form, creating a puzzle more closely resembling a traditional one with lots of little cardboard pieces that can quickly dominate a floor or a dining room table.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFZQV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Learn to Read (Preschool)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48584.9007199266294589.069a6d75-161e-4a80-a739-3fd0d6456417.91ebdc6b-1ca8-4501-95dd-782bcac68000","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14788.9007199266294589.2d721035-59b2-43b6-bca7-02a9c46d6463.9c3b5ba3-c761-403a-ac97-94d612ab597f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26880.9007199266294589.610920b5-ed90-4719-8b1f-82e13a50158c.28e2137f-7e39-4d56-8657-916ef0913e12","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33380.9007199266294589.72f926ad-2fbf-446d-977f-8ad4576275c4.b50c42ac-f964-4f4d-972e-03f5b6d216f3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":4.8,"RatingsCount":"6","PackageFamilyNames":["Intellijoy.KidsLearntoReadPreschool_aeskzhp7pykjg"],"ContentIds":["924434b6-eb68-f854-4485-a3e526eebbd0","80b78112-4632-042c-5ce2-d6c83b76bf70","67488c98-f2da-e508-d366-8df18e8a0644","11c9abba-7f9b-5b48-8495-12c1868248a6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Kids Learn to Read is the latest child-pleasing addition to Intellijoy's best-selling reading curriculum series, and is preceded by Kids ABC Letters and Kids ABC Phonics.\r\n\r\nKids Learn to Read is a delightful game that invites preschool-aged children to practice blending sounds together to read and spell simple words, such as \"dog\", \"sun\", and \"big\".\r\nIts six sections include:\r\n\r\n- In Magic Letter Bridge kids learn to blend letter sounds into words by moving Tommy the Turtle across the letter bridge as each letter is sounded out and a word is formed and pronounced.

Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \r\n\r\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSJCQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Eagle Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58924.9007199266579175.0ed5f251-a0df-4d42-bd4e-71d70531aadf.de690fc4-c00f-4239-9cc9-11c75ca55dd9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39633.9007199266579175.4c428e7a-6c15-4a13-bed9-eb2516f1639e.a88ba736-faa3-46bf-bf69-e6bac7f0824a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£0.79","Price":0.79,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["GlutenFreeGames.EagleSimulator_f7c4a2qk8qxct"],"ContentIds":["3b07db19-01f1-d8d9-f19a-5f107f598521"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Soar through the skies and live life as a majestic Bald Eagle!

But now they’re even more powerful and madder than ever.\r\n\r\nYou’ll have access to older, time-tested turrets, as well as completely new types of weapons. It’s up to you to decide how to spend your available budget. Should you build new towers or upgrade and fortify the ones you already have? Turrets vary in terms of their attack range, firing speed, and damage type. The only way to win is to combine them so that they complement and strengthen one another.\r\n\r\nThe flexible difficulty settings will allow every player to get as much enjoyment out of the game as possible. If you’re an experienced commander, you’ll love the merciless, intense battles where the countdown where even a fraction of a second is vital to success and everything hinges on your ability to choose and arrange your turrets wisely. If you’re a new player, you’ll easily be able to train and prepare yourself for serious battles.\r\n\r\nEither way, the thoughtfully designed maps and wide range of available turrets will provide you with virtually endless tactical options. Thanks to the stunning, detailed landscapes, painstakingly drawn towers, and incredible special effect, you won’t be able to take your eyes off the screen.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the game have been meticulously balanced, including tower statistics, enemy strength, terrain characteristics, and special weapons.

For example if you lower a tax rate, you'll see what the simulation calculates as new values afterwards, in dollars, people, crimes per 100.000, interest rate, life expectancy in years, and similar.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nThere are goals to fulfill, like decreasing the crime rate or achieving a certain public health or education rating, but it is already interesting to try to tamper with the various options alone: What happens if you lower the minimum wage? What if you change the length of maternity leave? Or the retirement age? You can also do more serious changes like introducing censorship laws, compulsory military service, cash bans, or universal basic income.\r\n\r\nThere are military options, so you can start a war with any country in the world, and adjust its operation mode while the conflict is active. But be sure not to let it run out of control. Some countries for example also have a nuclear option, of course.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a media and public relations system, where you can read the most interesting headlines, and try to influence the media with PR stunts, interviews, and similar. \r\n\r\nCountries\r\n\r\nYou can play as the USA, Germany, Russia, France, and Austria: These are the countries the simulation was implemented and tested to work nicely. But there are also additional countries and scenarios which can be downloaded. It is also possible to create new countries and scenarios on your own and share them with others.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVMJKPVTHZZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Queen's Quest 4: Sacred Truce (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30896.13860494228365392.9d329651-9af5-4681-b892-dbd49905ab43.362742b6-e340-4fb3-8226-77c2e106878d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44339.13860494228365392.9d329651-9af5-4681-b892-dbd49905ab43.793d313e-fe1b-4a4b-a687-41cc70f1389e","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55378.13860494228365392.9d329651-9af5-4681-b892-dbd49905ab43.1e6cca49-e64b-4530-94f6-1c8d10c0be7d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41724.13860494228365392.7d44eb2a-d8c5-4a6f-bf61-14b9784021e3.d742ba5f-f4c4-4fc1-aade-a1f608348ee8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.481.13860494228365392.7d44eb2a-d8c5-4a6f-bf61-14b9784021e3.e9de201f-5654-4dda-ab1b-5b32cc10e822","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17112.13860494228365392.7d44eb2a-d8c5-4a6f-bf61-14b9784021e3.69f681bc-4946-46d6-bf48-1e1d4bb91745","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£5.79","Price":5.79,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.QueensQuest4SacredTruceFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["788b9cf1-4e12-a9e3-b5c0-35d1099350c4","3afc3281-f756-1038-2773-f5af781fc920","864754a4-7429-5307-48e3-6fbf8f16bb66","1fc4675d-9566-18a7-ba91-ff096ec1066c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nThe realm of the Five Kingdoms faces a formidable challenge.

is a brand-new title from the creators of This War of Mine. It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\r\n\r\nWhat decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And...\r\n\r\n...who will you become in the process?\r\n\r\nMAKE THE LAW\r\nSociety is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.\r\n\r\nWEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES\r\nSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.\r\n\r\nDEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE FROSTLAND\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.\r\n\r\nGO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN\r\nThe main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle. Frostpunk offers different scenarios and additional updates with new content will be added in the future.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFVSG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Defense zone 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.32001.9007199266293401.7a9551cc-9a07-4da5-bd71-606e3ae9e784.c2ca721e-15fc-4ae2-aebe-7b50b370b650","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60055.9007199266293401.7b6d0362-1f79-4d2e-81ed-96d1175a0f6a.c51a68cc-86ba-4108-b71e-7f3b2439510d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47957.9007199266293401.a95e7d0a-d0d3-4cdc-8341-c8134b7dd67a.e5a6a57d-1384-49d7-9882-370f4a53f2d3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"41","PackageFamilyNames":["10991ArtemKotov.Defensezone2_6acec3smeeeap"],"ContentIds":["762d3252-3763-ae89-80ab-15bf029ddfeb","3fe124bb-4363-c402-a905-d16097a4dcb3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The new, engaging levels are even more stunning and impressive.

You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.\r\n\r\nControl almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.\r\n\r\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle. Sophisticated engineers has created the systems that will safely accelerate you to 25,500 ft/s, into a free fall orbit, with the Moon as the destination.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Reentry, an orbital

Vince’s adventure takes him from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou to find the whereabouts of his keeper, Madam Charmaine.\r\n\r\nIn true voodoo style, Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n• Voodoo combat action: Players can employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, players must actually USE dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \"no pain, no gain.\" \r\n\r\n• Magical voodoo world: Thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers. \r\n\r\n• Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Vince must master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete his quest. \r\n\r\n• Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Play Anywhere: yours to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Live features including earning achievements and sharing game clips.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5QH8J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"3D Mahjong.","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34913.13510798887157147.c50b8f91-42a6-407a-a5f6-bdbba210ad90.f62484e0-10d2-46c4-9d55-e91521b82af2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65327.13510798887157147.65b3981a-3ab2-425e-9d18-14c7fe248a68.05e2275f-d9e0-4789-af66-bb1ee0b10a73","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["44630ChaoZeng.39431542CE301_66trf94yww210"],"ContentIds":["a0b16999-d63d-d06f-bb90-b4646ad975fc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mahjong 3D adds a new and exiting twist to the classic Mahjong puzzle games. \r\n\r\nIn this game, the Mahjong board is not layered flat on a table.

Can you find the matching pairs and clear away all the tiles? You can grab and twist the shape in the middle to see all the matches you can make!\r\n\r\nThe clock is ticking, and whatever time is left on the timer by the end of the level is the time you will get to complete the next mahjong puzzle. In each round, you can win time bonuses by creating speed matches (a match made within 2 seconds following the previous match) and consecutive matches (a match made using the same tiles). This way you can win lots of extra time for the next round!\r\n\r\nThis MahJong game has all the classic tiles you’ll recognise right away: The Four Winds, the Three Dragons, and the three suits of Nine Bamboos (Bams), Nine Circles (Dots) and the Nine Characters.

The first player to remove all his pieces from the board is the winner. Although the play is highly skilful, the fact that the moves rely on the roll of the dice introduces an element of luck allowing even a novice to win the odd game against a world champion.\r\n\r\nBackgammon has been played throughout the world for thousands of years.
