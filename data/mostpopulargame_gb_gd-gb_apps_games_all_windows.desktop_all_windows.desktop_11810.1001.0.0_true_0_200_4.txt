Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NMJN6ZDS7RK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Blackjack HD Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14103.13686785191006808.fd6af37a-ca6a-4b6f-8f3f-2ba110051e93.3c75e67a-13c0-4483-a06d-d6de1f9ef887","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#697C00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13541.13686785191006808.04e42b7e-f0ee-4c0c-8d80-3751de56836a.bfac5450-bdde-4b89-97ad-0abf1e7e795a","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#697C00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25115.13686785191006808.782e419e-2b12-4b5b-9985-d29cc01bc0ef.c2045833-0516-4ba0-9dff-6d5e3343df29","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#697C00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49868.13686785191006808.cdff8508-55dc-4b7a-9c02-c5b7352b6f24.d847f286-6e54-4074-b0dd-b5eff753be88","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#697C00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22892.13686785191006808.f5833ae2-7e72-48b3-bf2d-fe778ead4bc3.6bb1d50d-672a-412f-854b-2c2ad9598428","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#697C00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58044.13686785191006808.23709351-aa76-4ba9-a74a-96e44c944749.a577d49c-904a-437b-a7d4-84f8a606c105","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#697C00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["60AC5286.BlackjackHD_ynqp2pc461sw0"],"ContentIds":["55f152b2-492d-c385-3bba-287451753d76","e96bbbce-bfb0-0870-d0d7-2c21af9205e0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Blackjack HD is a fun and addictive casino card game.

New graphics! We will continue updating the game. Thank you for your support of independent game developers! \r\n\r\nUse your periscope to target and destroy enemy ships. Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here:

Tycoon is an indie business strategy game about Computer Evolution and starting your own company in the 70s. Lead the research race until 2034, create the best hardware and operating system, take care of your infrastructure and even handle your marketing. Find video game gems to promote them on your platforms, conquer the global market and became literally immortal!\r\n\r\nComputer Tycoon is different from other building/tycoon games because it has a \"grand strategy game\" aspect. You will control your \"computer empire\" viewing a world map and managing resources.\r\n\r\nStart your adventure in the 70s as a small business somewhere in the world. Learn more about hardware and software inventions that were the first steps to our current modern world, and get a taste of what is waiting for us in the future. Find the classic video games and help a new culture to be born.\r\n\r\nIn Computer Tycoon the decisions you make during development really matter. Take advantage of the technology, upgrade and design combinations! Does your product need more computing capacity or should you focus more on features, low price or prestige? Maybe change to portable computers or develop more easy-to-use Operating Systems? These decisions will have a major impact on the success of your company.\r\n\r\nExpand your corporation in a smart way into multiple countries, build more offices, factories, laboratories and other required facilities. Poor countries have cheaper labor, but richer countries will give you more educated engineers.\r\n\r\nHaving the best product isn't enough. You must take care of people's needs or even \"change their needs\" using different marketing tools. Balance your budget well between development, production, marketing, and expansion.\r\n\r\nWe'll all die one day... but not in Computer Tycoon! You can win the game by becoming a monopoly or reaching the technological singularity if you are fast and healthy enough. Healthy? Yes, you have a small chance to die in the game, so you should regularly check your health.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5XC9K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"World Cricket Championship 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1065.13510798886389436.c9152b15-0139-4fa4-950d-3f10b7318066.007aaf79-e736-4165-8f5a-d927a8b150fb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56114.13510798886389436.2232dd36-760a-404f-8ff3-8c92a6b3c752.3621d10c-8e9f-498f-b210-c51f15bd464d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28000.13510798886389436.ae50e3b0-78f1-4a7f-9dfc-8c3565ee5456.de5828ac-8791-4e35-a1a8-f83da54ab82d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30840.13510798886389436.81818586-da0d-4f04-9354-0f87c780bba9.a983fcda-3aa0-4d54-b737-82ec4163c738","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"92","PackageFamilyNames":["NextwaveMultimediaPvtLtd.WCC2_jxdd5nhqtb94j"],"ContentIds":["fac009f1-2abf-6741-bad1-0d5c0480787d","34b4e21e-1294-b4d7-37b9-2c0c2f7cc01d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Winner, Game of the year 2015, People's Choice, Nasscom Gaming Forum Awards 2015\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Next Generation in Mobile Cricket Gaming!

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N3D60HP9CDH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO REAL BOUT FATAL FURY SPECIAL","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6315.13934211005770924.82d8fbf1-7dde-4286-a46c-91a397bdeb77.2a3c38e2-04aa-4ba4-93fb-7641c6853905","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49179.13934211005770924.82d8fbf1-7dde-4286-a46c-91a397bdeb77.ad8bfd1e-6422-41a2-a0cf-ccfaca481a96","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9929.13934211005770924.82d8fbf1-7dde-4286-a46c-91a397bdeb77.791c1e4b-9a91-4dde-8bb6-deadd2f8b1cb","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37866.13934211005770924.82d8fbf1-7dde-4286-a46c-91a397bdeb77.8fe162e4-87f9-4426-af5a-62fc34c975f9","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13.13934211005770924.82d8fbf1-7dde-4286-a46c-91a397bdeb77.38fc7bfc-bf08-409b-9375-b08c946af3f6","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£6.09","Price":6.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOREALBOUTFATALFURYSPECI_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["04be4498-5655-5e18-ac66-50cc68c1d103"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"REAL BOUT FATAL FURY SPECIAL is a fighting game released by SNK in 1997.

exciting adventure of a brave girl who found herself in a fantasy world. She has to find a way to stop the cursed beasts awakened after sleeping for a thousand years and coming to life for reasons unknown.\r\n\r\nLost Lands: the Golden Curse is an adventurous hidden object game-quest with puzzles and mini-games scattered through the boundless spaces of the fantasy world – from the volcano valleys to the Druid forest, from the deep caves to the floating islands.\r\n\r\nOne fine day an ordinary good-looking housewife, Susan, while visiting the museum of arts drops by an old looking glass which, for whatever reason, starts to beckon her up. When she touched the looking-glass, Susan was immediately transported into a magical fantasy world of the Lost Lands. She has been known for her heroic deeds as Susan the Warrior there.\r\nSusan meets a child named Fiora, and the girl takes Susan to her great-grandfather, Maaron.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed.

You can either play the easy Draw 1 games where most games are winnable, or if you feel up-to the challenge, try your luck with Draw 3 and Vegas play modes.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy adding a personal touch to your game, customize the backdrop and card backs with photos from your own photo library for unlimited personalization possibilities. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n+ Draw 1 card (Easy) \r\n+ Draw 3 cards (Hard) \r\n+ 10 Kinds of App Backgrounds \r\n+ 14 Kinds of Card Backgrounds \r\n+ Crisp, beautiful, and easy to read cards \r\n+ Portrait or landscape \r\n+ Efficient, fast, and sensible game interface \r\n+ Single tap to place a card or drag and drop \r\n+ Standard Klondike scoring \r\n+ Smart hints show potentially useful moves \r\n+ Custom backdrops & cards from your photos \r\n+ Timer, moves, and statistics \r\n+ Unlimited Undos \r\n+ Auto-Complete option to finish a solved game \r\n+ Fun & challenging achievements \r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six downturned cards (from left to right). On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKJTJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire Online","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.19669.9007199266522033.5ffb889b-767d-4d33-9dda-59e51f926e6b.ad558517-080b-4e58-b465-2b4facf9c4ca","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.26266.9007199266522033.88f6d9d8-a592-4f21-919f-56b0c6ec63ac.9ab39899-f898-4bc9-b29c-a1067b778c0a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10660.9007199266522033.ea15881d-20ba-4508-afcd-7eb4bc9552fa.d02ecd06-dbfc-4685-8392-02adb7a02a05","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46085.9007199266522033.65120fa8-9fbd-4bf2-8d3b-160f1651d9c0.1fc5a717-c8ed-4516-b0c8-d7d40f11be1a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23063.9007199266522033.dfe8a787-a936-4059-be96-c1a1b2fbb559.85431fa5-963a-4b84-b237-c567ad012bdd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.19669.9007199266522033.5ffb889b-767d-4d33-9dda-59e51f926e6b.ad558517-080b-4e58-b465-2b4facf9c4ca","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10482.9007199266522033.4ae3157f-36f5-48b9-9dd1-8a597218383b.2a31163b-1894-4b99-9565-de37f92dcc0a","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3353.9007199266522033.4ae3157f-36f5-48b9-9dd1-8a597218383b.a79a7b45-1ffd-45d3-966a-5d51d16e4643","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"58","PackageFamilyNames":["24528JimmyDickinson.SolitaireOnline_nww69jnfa3hjr"],"ContentIds":["b15d6abb-42a3-8f3b-4efd-75d9f0298688","6ef7b64b-8d30-697e-4c83-54b9208e6f90","fb38e3dc-c1f0-731b-e467-42f2654781b5","d2009ebc-38e7-5348-df49-4a91aeea26ec"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Solitaire Online (Klondike)- Single player or challenge a friend online!\r\n\r\nPlay different skill levels.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging.

She is a girl with big dreams or let's say, a girl that likes dreaming. She was always in love with those stories about princesses who find their prince and she was hoping that one day, she will meet her prince too. For some girl those things are just a fantasy, just something that happens in the stories but for Emily it is something more. It is her biggest dream and her biggest belief.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Emily is visiting the royal palace. She likes to visit those places, imagining that she could be in the place of some of those princesses. Those thoughts make her very excited, so she dreams about something like that even more. Walking around the palace, Emily notices a portrait of the former princess. Everything was just fined with the princess except the fact that she looked exactly like Emily! Emily could not believe her eyes, she is completely amazed by the similarity between the princess and her, so she decides to explore little bit more about this princess.

Since the animals walk on their own, the player can only influence them by giving them commands, like build a bridge, dig a hole or redirect all animals in the other direction. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for this multiple combination of commands are necessary. The game is presented in a 2D site view. \r\n\r\nWhile Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings, it however doesn't try to be an exact clone, it has included a few ideas of its own, like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. It has also a few new actions, like the jumper which weren't presented in the original game.

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \r\n\r\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge.

If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.\r\nTry to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.\r\nAfter the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io).

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NW2X82F2DM3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Coloring Book 2018","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44256.14453296418804362.77994b1f-bb43-40cb-b141-4b5b81e0dfc3.097664e1-9865-4760-8022-398fbd5b9f42","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54048.14453296418804362.e72c1d43-1952-4099-9498-98d416da5b4e.e172b3f2-a6d8-4b1b-85cb-179f9db9807e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44256.14453296418804362.77994b1f-bb43-40cb-b141-4b5b81e0dfc3.097664e1-9865-4760-8022-398fbd5b9f42","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"31","PackageFamilyNames":["5895BlastCrushGames.ColoringBook2018_f1613047p3868"],"ContentIds":["221dff03-7a68-52bb-ce63-78dc5b405c61","eafde61b-d9ee-0fbb-5894-84c0ad49d178"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Coloring Book 2018 has a lot of images in different categories.
